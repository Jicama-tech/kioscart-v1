/**
 * The campaign template language: `{{name}}`-style placeholders plus
 * `{Hi|Hello|Hey}` spintax.
 *
 * THIS FILE HAS A TWIN. frontend/src/lib/campaignTemplate.ts implements the
 * same rules for the live preview and for the one-by-one "Open in WhatsApp"
 * links, and the two must agree character for character: the preview for
 * customer X is promised to be exactly what X receives. Change one, change
 * the other, and run the shared test vectors on both. The one backend-only
 * addition is renderedLength(), which the browser has no use for.
 *
 * Rendering is two passes, in a fixed order:
 *
 *  1. Spintax, on the raw template. Every `{a|b|c}` that is not part of a
 *     `{{…}}` token becomes ONE of its options. The choice is not random: it
 *     is fnv1a32(seed + ":" + n), where the seed is the customer id and `n`
 *     counts spintax groups left to right. Deterministic, so the preview and
 *     the send pick the same greeting; per customer, so a hundred customers
 *     do not all get the identical message — which is the pattern WhatsApp
 *     treats as bulk spam.
 *
 *  2. Placeholders, on the result. Values go in as plain text and are never
 *     scanned again, so a customer called "{a|b}" or "{{price}}" cannot inject
 *     markup into the message — the order of the passes is what guarantees it.
