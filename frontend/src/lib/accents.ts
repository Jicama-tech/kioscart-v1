/**
 * Accent colours for stat cards and initial avatars.
 *
 * Two palettes, two different jobs:
 *
 *   STAT_ACCENTS   — categorical identity for KPI tiles. Assigned in FIXED
 *                    ORDER per surface (card 1 is always blue, card 2 always
 *                    emerald…), never cycled by rank, so a card keeps its
 *                    colour when a sibling is added or hidden.
 *
 *   AVATAR_ACCENTS — identity-by-hash for a person with no photo. Not a data
 *                    encoding: nothing is read *off* the colour, it just makes
 *                    a row scannable, so hashing over a wider ring is fine.
 *
 * Both were validated rather than eyeballed:
 *
 *   STAT_ACCENTS (the six 600 steps) passes the categorical checks in BOTH
 *   modes — lightness band, chroma floor, normal-vision separation and >=3:1
 *   contrast against the light and dark surfaces. The one warning is
 *   amber<->emerald at CVD deltaE 7.9 (protan), inside the 6-8 floor band that is
 *   legal only alongside a second encoding: every tile pairs its colour with a
 *   distinct icon AND a text label, so identity never rests on hue alone.
 *
 *   AVATAR_ACCENTS carries text, so it answers to WCAG instead: all ten pairs
 *   clear AA body contrast (worst 4.51:1 light, 8.02:1 dark), and the hues are
 *   spaced around the wheel so two avatars in one list read apart.
 *
 * Keep the 600 step if you add a stat hue, and re-run the validator.

/**
 * Background + initials colour. Both halves are needed for the contrast to hold.
 *
 * Ten hues, listed in wheel order so the spacing is visible when reading the
 * list rather than something you have to plot. Ten rather than twelve on
 * purpose: the earlier set also carried teal and sky, which sat 13deg off
 * emerald and 10deg off cyan respectively. At avatar size — a 32px circle
 * holding two letters — those read as the same colour, so the extra entries
 * bought more collisions rather than more separation.
 *
 * Every neighbouring pair is now at least 19deg apart except orange/amber at
 * 13deg. That one is kept because an avatar is never colour alone: it carries
 * the person's initials, so hue is a scanning aid, never the identifier.
 *
 * Contrast is measured, not assumed — all ten clear WCAG AA for body text in
 * both modes (worst 4.51:1 light on amber, 8.02:1 dark on indigo). If you add
 * or swap a hue, re-check both numbers and the gap to its neighbours.
